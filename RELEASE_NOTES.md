# Release Notes - v1.1.0

## 🚀 Flatten Upgrade

This release introduces a powerful upgrade to the "Flatten" feature, giving you more control over how you reset your folders.

### ✨ New Features

- **Enhanced Flatten Dialog**: Now offers two distinct modes:
  - **Flatten Organized Only**: The classic, safe behavior. Only moves files from folders created by the app (marked with `.sfo_organized`).
  - **Flatten EVERYTHING**: A new power-user option that flattens ALL subdirectories in the target folder, regardless of who created them. Great for fixing messy directory structures.
- **Improved GUI**: Updated dialogs and tooltips for better usability.
